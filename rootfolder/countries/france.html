        This is a traditional French soup made of onions and beef stock, usually
        served with croutons and melted cheese on top. Dating back to Roman
        times, this was traditionally a peasant dish although the current
        version dates from the 18th century. The soup’s unique flavor comes from
        the caramelization of the onions, which often have brandy or sherry
        added during the slow-cooking process. If you’re in a soup mood, why not
        try Marseille’s traditional soupe de poisson à la rouille. Once a
        fisherman’s favorite, this soup is characterized by a dollop of garlic
        and saffron mayonnaise placed on top.

      <q>
        The word soufflé comes from the French verb ‘to blow’ and, and the name
        suggests, this is a light, airy dessert. The dish dates back to the
        early 18th century and nowadays is a staple on dessert menus around the
        world. The crispy chocolatey crust is perfect for letting the creamy
        chocolate ooze out for a rich surprise. However, it doesn’t have to be
        sweet. In fact, cheese soufflés are just as delicious if you’re looking
        for something a little saltier.

    <blockquote>
      <q>
        Not just a lovable cartoon about a friendly rat, ratatouille is also one
        of France’s most iconic dishes. From Provence, the dish sees vegetables
        shallow-fried and then layered in a casserole dish before being baked in
        an oven. French chefs have been debating whether the vegetables need
        cooking beforehand for centuries, but however you prepare it, the
        results are still great. This traditional peasant dish can be a side
        dish, appetizer, or a main course, and tastes great with red wine and
        fresh, crusty bread. A similar Basque dish is pipérade, which typically
        adds ham and sometimes eggs to the stewed vegetable mix.
